/**
 * Launches a new coroutine on the minecraft main thread without blocking the current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [Job].
 * The coroutine is cancelled when the resulting job is [cancelled][Job.cancel].
 *
 * The coroutine context is inherited from a [Plugin.scope]. Additional context elements can be specified with [context] argument.
 * If the context does not have any dispatcher nor any other [ContinuationInterceptor], then [Plugin.minecraftDispatcher] is used.
 * The parent job is inherited from a [Plugin.scope] as well, but it can also be overridden
 * with a corresponding [context] element.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution if the current thread is already the minecraft server thread.
 * If the current thread is not the minecraft server thread, the coroutine is moved to the [org.bukkit.scheduler.BukkitScheduler] and executed
 * in the next server tick schedule.
 * Other start options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case,
 * the coroutine [Job] is created in _new_ state. It can be explicitly started with [start][Job.start] function
 * and will be started implicitly on the first invocation of [join][Job.join].
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine do not cancel the parent job or any other child jobs. All uncaught exceptions
 * are logged to [Plugin.getLogger] by default.
 *
 * @param context The coroutine context to start. Should almost be always be [Plugin.minecraftDispatcher]. Async operations should be
 * be created using [withContext] after using the default parameters of this method.
 * @param start coroutine start option. The default value is [CoroutineStart.DEFAULT].
 * @param block the coroutine code which will be invoked in the context of the provided scope.
